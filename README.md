# LearnOpenGL
## Wanting to create a game in using OpenGL. 
### Potential Project Ideas
1. 2D Game in the desert that transitions into oasis (some kind of danger timer present in real (desert) world while inside oasis)
2. 2D Game focused on arctic survival (temperature countdown, crafting, hunting)
3. 3D Game with portals (flow based like Assassin's Creed 1, Mirrors Edge)
